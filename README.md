# Deep_Relation_Extraction
Extract relation within unstructured sentence by using deep learning techniques

A relation knowledge graph is consisted of directed graph where a node is a tuple (entity_1, relation, entity_2).

Relation extraction task is to predict the relation between two entities within a sentence or a paragraph.

This project uses supervised learning and distant supervision learning to train deep relation extraction model.

Three models are implemented: CNN with position embedding, LSTM with attention and multi-head self-attention.
